jquerypp-release
================

Distribution of the jquerypp accessible and taged with bower.
Basically it's just all versions taken from (here)[https://github.com/bitovi/jquerypp/tree/gh-pages/release/] and tagged with the correct version.
In addition to the tags correct bower files are added making jquerypp easier useable.
The fourth version number is just to make it possible for us making correcting minor releases without chaning the real logic.

Usage
-----

Just add jquerypp-release to your bower dependency section.
Now make use of it depending on your use case.
Use the amd, the raw, ... packages.
For a more detailed documentation better checkout the full jquerypp documentation.
